		<p><img align="left" src="intel.png" width="320" height="200">Source: TheVerge <br><br>Intel’s next generation of desktop processors are here with the company announcing its new 9th Gen Core chips today at its fall hardware event.<br><br>To that end, Intel revealed its new Core i9-9900K, which Intel says is “the best gaming processor in the world. Period.” The i9-9900K offers eight cores and 16 threads, clocked at base frequency of 3.6 GHz, which can be boosted up to 5.0 GHz.<br>Despite Intel jumping ahead to its 9th Gen moniker, the new chips are still based off Intel’s existing 14nm process, which the company has been using as far back as the 5th Gen Broadwell chips back in 2014. The 9th Gen chips are specifically using Intel’s 14nm++ process that it introduced last year with its 8th Gen Coffee Lake chips, with Intel continuing to delay production of its truly next-gen 10nm Cannon Lake chips until 2019.<br><br>Intel also notes that these are its first desktop processors to have hardware fixes for the Meltdown Variant 3 and L1 Terminal Fault issues, with the remaining protections done through software. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17950968/intel-9th-gen-core-chips-2018-desktop-processors-8-core-i9-9900k">Full Story</a>

		<h2>Samsung launches its second foldable, the <b>Galaxy Z Flip</b></h2>
		<p><img align="left" src="zflip.jpg" width="320" height="200">Source:Rappler<br><br>Following the Samsung Galaxy Fold released in late 2019 is the brand’s 2nd foldable phone, the Galaxy Z Flip, officially launched, Tuesday, February 11, US time. Unlike the Fold, which unfolds as a tablet, the Z Flip sports a clamshell design, joining Motorola and its new Razr in reviving the once-popular form factor. Another difference: the Z Flip uses foldable glass, the first of its kind, as opposed to the plastic screen found on the Fold.<br><br>A “Hideaway Hinge” allows the phone to, in Samsung’s words, open at a range of angles, like a laptop screen. Through a design, one can put the phone on a table, open it at a laptop-like angle to do certain things such as video chatting and watching YouTube videos. On YouTube for instance, when in free-standing mode, the bottom half of the screen can show controls, other clips, and comments while the top shows the video.Free-standing mode would also allow the phone to be propped up on a table when taking photos or videos, as opposed to trying to keep a standard phone standing. Its cameras are a 12MP F1.8 wide angle with optical image stabilization, a 12MP ultra-wide F2.2, and on the front, a 10MP F2.4 shooter.When folded, an always-on display shows the date, time, and battery on the 1.1-inch display on the front.The Z Flip also has a multi-window feature similar to the Galaxy Fold’s. <a href="https://www.rappler.com/technology/news/251536-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-launch-specs-features">Full Story</a>
		<h2>Motorola resurrects the Razr as a <b>Foldable Smartphone</b></h2>
		<p><img align="left" src="razr.jpg" width="300" height="200">Source: TheVerge<br><br>The Razr is back, but now it’s an Android smartphone that can fold in half. Motorola has officially announced its much-rumored (and much-leaked) modern spin on the iconic flip phone. The 2019 Razr keeps the same general form factor but replaces the T9 keypad and small LCD with a 6.2-inch foldable plastic OLED panel and Android 9 Pie. The new Razr is a fundamentally different take on the foldable phones that we’ve seen so far: instead of turning a modern-sized phone into a smaller tablet, it turns a conventional-sized smartphone into something much smaller and more pocketable. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963294/motorola-razr-new-foldable-smartphone-android-hands-on-flip-phone-photos-video">Full Story</a></p>
